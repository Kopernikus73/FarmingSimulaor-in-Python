# Farming Simulator alpha0.1

Hello guys,

This is a alpha-test-Version of my Farming Game that I program in python
I will try to upload a new Update every week, but this could be complicated due to the fact that I only program this in my free time when I don't have anything else to do
So please forgive if I can't upload every week :)


To play it, just run the "game.py" file

----------
USE OF CODE

You can use my code, for anything, if you want :D
There is definitely a whole bunch of better code that does the same thing as mine
But if you want to use it. Go on :)
